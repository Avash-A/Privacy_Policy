  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <h2>Transfer of Your Personal Data</h2>
  <p>Your information, including Personal Data, is processed at the Company's operating offices and in any other places where the parties involved in the processing are located. It means that this information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of Your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from Your jurisdiction.</p>
  <p>Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by Your submission of such information represents Your agreement to that transfer.</p>
  <p>The Company will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of Your Personal Data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of Your data and other personal information.</p>

You may also contact Us to request access to, correct, or delete any personal information that You have provided to Us.</p>
  <p>Please note, however, that We may need to retain certain information when we have a legal obligation or lawful basis to do so.</p>

  <h2>Disclosure of Your Personal Data</h2>

  <h2>Security of Your Personal Data</h2>
  <p>The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While We strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Your Personal Data, We cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If You are a parent or guardian and You are aware that Your child has provided Us with Personal Data, please contact Us. If We become aware that We have collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, We take steps to remove that information from Our servers.</p>
